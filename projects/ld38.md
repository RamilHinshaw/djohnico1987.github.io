description: This was a game made for the ludum dare 38 with the theme "Small World". I did all the programming and I found a partner on the internet to do all the 3D modeling. This project was a blast and I am very happy with the results. It is an RTS game with management involved. You have your villages live off the land while defending themselves from the unknown at night.

This Ludum Dare was special since It was my first team Jam. The theme for this game was "Small World" so we decided to make a city management type game. I worked on the programming and a guy I found on /r/inat known as DarkNinja who is very talented in low poly art did all the art work. I had less time to worry about art and can focus on all the coding especially since we decided to do a RTS game which is program heavy compered to most genres. I'm very proud of the end result despite not implementing everything.

The game was about making a base by getting resources from the land. The three resources are food, wood, and meat. As you place more huts you got more people. Every night monsters come and attack the villagers. 

I was very very proud of the end result of this game. It is very playable and turns out to be very fun. There are alot of youtubers player the game and one gave it the attention of over 80,000 views! :O 

As much as I love making games, I love to see the experience someone gets when they play one of my games.
