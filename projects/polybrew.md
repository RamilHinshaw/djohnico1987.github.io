description: A fun side project I'm working on with a partner on the internet. Similar to my RPG shop idea for Ludum Dare 38 but instead of a shopkeeper you are a Alchemist making various potions. THe best part of the game is it encourages creativity with the ingredients. Just throw things into the cauldron and making something that you can sell to various npcs.

Polybrew
================

This is a game that Darkninja are I are currently working on. It is a game that allows you create various potions with different ingredients. You can cut (knife), smash (Pestle), and cook (oven) causing the ingredients to have various effects when put into the pot.

NPC's would come and request a type of potion they want. There needs depend on their occupation and the attributes associated with it. For example an assassin would come and may want to coat his arrows in something non lethal to capture his target. The player would give something like a paralysis, or sleeping potion opposed to using poison.

The game is still in its early beta stages but progress how been made with it constantly. Hopefully it will see the day of light.
