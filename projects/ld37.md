description: This was a game made for the ludum dare 37 with the theme "Small Room". Since I lacked the 3D modeling skills at the time I wanted to work on a game that was programming heavy. I love RPG's so what if instead of being that hero in your typically fantasy game, instead you were the shop keeper for the heroes and NPC's.

Here comes another Ludam Dare :) . This is a project I worked on for the Ludum Dare 37 with the theme of "One Room". Here it is a management game where you buy and put things on the tables to sell your goods at higher prices from the supplier :P

I unfortunately didn't go through my entire list of ToDo's: http://pastebin.com/A79gSzT1 There were no animations added, and there where a lot of features programmed (personalites, occupaction, age, ect) that was not in the final build. But that is the nature of programming in ludum dare.

But it works quite well (aside from the web version), just doesn't have an end goal, but still a fun concept.

From this Ludam Dare, I've learned a very important lesson. Don't spend time planning for most of the jam (woops) and don't write useless unwanted code. I've programmed a lot of things for the AI that didn't get used. I need to prioritize the base game then add all the goodies later.
