This is Project Quick spook, this was a fun 3 day game I created that worked similar to slenderman, I made this game for a friend so he can play this horror game.</p>

Notice that both the menus are different. Little did he know the game was secretly Multiplayer! The monster was actually controlled by a player and not an AI :P (Of course he got the left side of the game)</p>

On the left screen is the player, his job is suppose to go around collect pages to win the game. He has a flashlight and a sprint bar. He has to run away from the “AI” monster. The monster however is not an AI and is actually a player and the player’s role goal is to have a lot of “close” encounters with the player and make the horror experience better without revealing to the player it is another player. :)</p>

Its very dark for the player but for the monster there is no fog and  the monster can see the player through the walls.</p>

Here are the batteries that I modeled. Everything but the barrels, boxes, and monster were 3d modeled by me. The closer the player got to the monster the louder the music plays.</p>

Here is an example how she can see through walls.</p>

Even scarier the monster can crawl and plays a different song  that sounds more dreaded and urgent. Fun way to increase your friends heart rate :P</p>
