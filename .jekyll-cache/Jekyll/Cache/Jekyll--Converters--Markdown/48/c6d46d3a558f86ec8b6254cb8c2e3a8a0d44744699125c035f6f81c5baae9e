This may look like a familiar game to you. I did this as a quick project to practice my 3D modeling and programming skills. Its Link from the Zelda franchise but instead of the hero of Hyrule he is just a chef. I followed this video to create this character https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFhc2SRAWDc  (I create all my human low-poly models in this kind of workflow)</p>

Most of the things in the game were modeled, animated, and programmed by me. I did the ground textures in ms paint XD</p>

The main highlight of this game was the dialogue system I created in this. Works similar like the original game.</p>
