<p>This is my project to test blendshapes with sliders. I create a tutorial video on how to do this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypRhJAfJXAc Everything in this game was done by scratch. I 3D modeled and textured the characters, houses, etc. The white mark there just represents there is an empty slot I can use for accessories like glasses or jewelry.</p>

Here you can see the face change based on the slider. The white mark on the forehead is just a placeholder showing its an empty slot for item/accessories (like earrings, glasses, and what not)</p>

Made a lot of different characters as a result, havenâ€™t done much with this project. Hope I can come back to this in the future.</p>
